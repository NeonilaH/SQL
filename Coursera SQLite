1. Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Address, 
  UPPER (City || ' '|| Country ||'') AS Location
FROM Customers
LIMIT 16

2. Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.
SELECT
LOWER ((SUBSTR (FirstName, 0, 5)) || ''|| (SUBSTR (LastName, 0, 3) ||'')) AS New
FROM Employees
